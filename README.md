# BookRecommendationSystem


Developed a powerful sentiment analyzer that leverages collaborative filtering techniques and the NLTK library to analyze a vast Amazon book review dataset sourced from Kaggle. 
Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Amazon book review dataset, uncovering valuable insights and trends that further informed our model's performance. 
To make this resource accessible, I deployed both the model and a user-friendly website on Hugging Face Spaces, ensuring its availability and usability for anyone interested in harnessing the insights derived from this sentiment analysis.
